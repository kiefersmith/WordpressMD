While finishing up with R-rockstar Hadley Wickham's book (<a href="https://realdataweb.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/free-book-r-for-data-science/" target="_blank">Free Book â€“ R for Data Science</a>), <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html">the section on model building</a> elaborates on something pretty cool - list columns.

Most of us have probably seen the following data frame column format:

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame("col_uno" = c(1,2,3),"col_dos" = c('a','b','c'), "col_tres" = factor(c("google", "apple", "amazon")))
```

And the output:
````{r, echo = TRUE}
df
````

This is an awesome way to organize data and one of R's strong points.  However, we can use list functionality to go deeper.  Check this out:
````{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasets)
````{r}
head(iris)

nested <- iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  nest()
````
````{r, echo = FALSE}
nested
````
Using `nest` we can compartmentalize our data frame for readability and more efficient iteration.  Here we can use `map` from the `purrr` package to compute the mean of each column in our nested data.

````{r}
means <- map(nested$data, colMeans)
````
````{r, echo = FALSE}
means
````
Once you're done messing around with data-ception, use `unnest` to revert your data back to its original state.
````{r}
head(unnest(nested))
````

I was pretty excited to learn about this property of data.frames and will definitely make use of it in the future.  If you have any neat ideas how this might be used, please feel free to share in the comments.




model <- function(df) {
    lm(data = df, Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width)
}
